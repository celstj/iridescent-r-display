## Original concept : jewellery display

Originally, this was going to be a decorative jewellery holder. Something simple, probably static. I was just messing around with acrylic shapes and display stands at that point.

Then somewhere along the way, the full set concept started forming and I began wondering if there was a cleaner way to display everything together. That's when the idea of a central holder popped up.

The iridescent acrylic made me think it could actually look really nice with some kind of light behind it, and that led to me adding the idea of a light source. And once I started imagining how the pieces could catch the light while turning like a sun-catcher, the rotating part just kind of happened. At that point, the idea stuck, so i ran with it.

# Shift to light-based interaction

## Material tests / ideas
### Base
- wireless charging in the middle, stationary, while outer parts of the base rotates via magnetic hold on 2 halves of a "semi circle", thrust bearing on the side of the center base to allow rotation.
- base includes rechargeable pack for the wireless pad, allow portability.
- etched visuals on top of the base for design purposes.
- light, thin fabric to cushion devices and sculpture feature.
- 

### Charging / power (thrust bearing, rotation)
- rechargeable pack compatible with wireless charging pad, allow portability and connect to power when recharging.
- magnetic pad/ placements outside of chargning area that puts sculpture/device in place
- detachmable from thet op in the middle so easy access to wireless charging while plug is on the bottom base
- outer bit is 2 halves instead of donut shaped, attached both pieces by using magnets or clear clasps?, attach iridescent beads to the 2â€™s inner circle, and the middle base will have a little shelve like indent groove curved so the beads can sit on it,, (gotta make sure the weight doesnt collapse or break itself though) *like little side way train tracks LMAO*

### Acrylic Material
- cast acrylic
- frosted acrylic
- iridescent film? 

### Lights
- small non-heat low-drain LED, small battery powered
- rechargable via charging port base
- lightly frosted acrylic (etching/sandblasting/laser on sculpt mold) for light scatter
- small airflow
- EST. 300mah ~ 500mah battery (according to sculpt width), include usb-c for easy wired charging
