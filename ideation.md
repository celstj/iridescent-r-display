## Original concept : jewellery display

Originally, this was going to be a decorative jewellery holder. Something simple, probably static. I was just messing around with acrylic shapes and display stands at that point.

Then somewhere along the way, the full set concept started forming and I began wondering if there was a cleaner way to display everything together. That's when the idea of a central holder popped up.

The iridescent acrylic made me think it could actually look really nice with some kind of light behind it, and that led to me adding the idea of a light source. And once I started imagining how the pieces could catch the light while turning like a sun-catcher, the rotating part just kind of happened. At that point, the idea stuck, so i ran with it.

- base includes rechargeable pack for the wireless pad, allow portability.
- etched visuals on top of the base for design purposes.
- light, thin fabric to cushion devices and sculpture feature.
