# Iridescent Rotating Display ðŸŒˆ
## A concept-stage rotating display that merges sculptural design with interactive utility.
Originally started as a personal collectorâ€™s stand, this project evolved into a hybrid concept exploring how physical display objects can deliver modularity, intuitive UX, and emotional resonance.

The display is planned to feature:
- A sculptural acrylic centerpiece that doubles as a light feature
- Wireless charging support (for both devices and the sculpture itself)
- A rotating base with magnetically attached plates, supported by sealed thrust bearings
- Modular components designed for interchangeable seasonal display sets

> Currently in concept phase. Components and design logic are still under iteration.

## Why This Exists
This project explores the intersection between physical craft, emotional UX, and modular function. I wanted to build something that wasn't just art or tech, but a hybrid object people could live with, something visually meaningful, physically engaging, and functionally intuitive.

### The Problem
Display pieces often sacrifice function for aesthetics, or vice versa. Most stay static. Few feel like they grow with the user.

### The Solution
A modular, beautifully designed rotating display that charges devices, lights up softly, and lets users swap out centerpiece components over time. Itâ€™s not static art, itâ€™s alive, shiftable, and centered around emotional familiarity in design.

### Features at a Glance
- Rotating base with magnet-locked plates  
- Sculptural centerpiece with glow-up lighting  
- Wireless charging pad concept  
- Collectorâ€™s mindset: seasonal + sentiments  
- Storage box, velvet-lined, like a dream anchor

## Development Notes
This project is part UX study, part creative tech challenge. My focus has been on balancing hardware feasibility with narrative design flow. How a collectorâ€™s object also serve as a utility and be emotionally engaging. Still actively designing housing, display flow, and potential materials.

## Design Philosophy
The goal was to create a display object that feels ambient and familiar, not overtly technological, but emotionally present. Itâ€™s designed to function as a quiet visual anchor in a space, like a light feature or art piece that blends with daily life while remaining meaningful.

## Challenges
- Creating a seamless rotation mechanism that remains stable with weight
- Aligning magnetic modularity with aesthetic form
- Planning physical UX with no formal industrial design background
- Integrating wireless power without overcomplicating form factor

## Behind the idea
It started with a dream, I saw a collection of delicate glass-like pieces, each one with a different design nestled into a velvet storage box, arranged like a puzzle. It stayed with me, the image became seed for the project.

At first, I thought it might make a lovely decorative set, something for display. But the more i sat with it, the more I wanted it to be worth holding onto, not just pretty but purposeful. That's how the idea grew into something interactive, a rotation platform that isnt just art but something you can use.

Wireless charging (rechargeable pad or power bank style), a glowing sculpture that doubles as a gentle light source, and modular slots to hold future season pieces. Each layer was designed to invite everyday magic, something beautiful and functional, even if it takes up space.

And just like in the dream, I've planned for the acrylic pieces to come with a storage case, returning full circle to that velvet-lined box.
