# Iridescent Rotating Display ðŸŒˆ
## A concept-stage rotating display that merges sculptural design with interactive utility.
Originally started as a personal collectorâ€™s stand, this project evolved into a hybrid concept exploring how physical display objects can deliver modularity, intuitive UX, and emotional resonance.

The display is planned to feature:
- A sculptural acrylic centerpiece that doubles as a light feature
- Wireless charging support (for both devices and the sculpture itself)
- A rotating base with magnetically attached plates, supported by sealed thrust bearings
- Modular components designed for interchangeable seasonal display sets

> Currently in concept phase. Components and design logic are still under iteration.

## Planned Features
- Acrylic sculpture + light integration
- Wireless charging base
- Modular, rotating mechanism (with magnetic locking system)
- Collector-friendly seasonal swaps
- Visual/emotional UX emphasis â€” designed to feel alive, not static

---

## Development Notes
This project is part UX study, part creative tech challenge. My focus has been on balancing hardware feasibility with narrative design flow. How a collectorâ€™s object also serve as a utility and be emotionally engaging. Still actively designing housing, display flow, and potential materials.

## Challenges
- Creating a seamless rotation mechanism that remains stable with weight
- Aligning magnetic modularity with aesthetic form
- Planning physical UX with no formal industrial design background
- Integrating wireless power without overcomplicating form factor
